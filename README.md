Whole thing together. Wasn't really sure where to find Switches for my model :(

Fun wing design on the bottom (I took way too much time making it).

Draco's Macropad! Likely for use with my wonderful soundboards.

### Inspiration

I wanted to create a macropad that allowed me to effectively spam sounds at my friends whilst in group calls. A noble cause, is it not?

### Challenges

I haven't used any of this before (save for VSCode), so... there's that. Despite the difficulty of using these initally, I actually really enjoyed the PCB making process! Fusion360 was alright, but it burnt me out a lot more than KiCAD, despite the simplicity of what I was making.
